Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.



Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

Write a function that returns the length of a string.



Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.

Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.



Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.



Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.



Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

Write a function that reverses a string.



Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

 function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.



Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.



Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);

The function should print the second half of the string

If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
